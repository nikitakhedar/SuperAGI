# GPT-2 Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a simplified GPT-2 model. The GPT-2 model, originally developed by OpenAI, is a transformer-based language model known for its ability to generate human-like text.

## Features

- Custom GPT-2 model architecture implemented in PyTorch.
- Components include embedding layers, multi-head attention, pointwise feedforward networks, and transformer layers.
- Random token generation for text synthesis.
- Basic structure to support further customization and expansion.

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- Python 3.6 or later

## Installation

To use this model, first ensure that PyTorch is installed. You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage

### Model Definition

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class EmbeddingLayer(nn.Module):
    # ... (Embedding Layer definition)

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    # ... (Multi-Head Attention definition)

class PointWiseFeedForwardNetwork(nn.Module):
    # ... (Pointwise Feedforward Network definition)

class TransformerLayer(nn.Module):
    # ... (Transformer Layer definition)

class GPT2(nn.Module):
    # ... (GPT2 Model definition)

# Initialize the model
model = GPT2(num_layers=12, d_model=768, num_heads=12, vocab_size=50257, d_ff=3072, dropout_rate=0.1)
