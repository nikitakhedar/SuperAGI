# Logistic Regression and Statistical Analysis Q&A

This document provides answers to a series of questions related to logistic regression, statistical analysis, and model training. The questions address practical scenarios in machine learning and statistical inference.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. Duplicate Feature in Logistic Regression

**Q:** What happens to the weights of a logistic regression model if a feature is duplicated?

**A:** When a feature `n` is duplicated, the weights for the original and duplicated features (`w_{new_n}` and `w_{new_{n+1}}`) are likely to be half of `w_n` from the original model. This is due to the gradient descent optimization redistributing the importance across both features. Other weights remain similar unless the duplication introduces significant multicollinearity.

### 2. Email Marketing Template Comparison

**Q:** How to determine which email template has the highest click-through rate with 95% confidence?

**A:** Based on the provided click-through rates, it seems likely that template E is better than A with over 95% confidence. Template B might be worse than A with over 95% confidence. The status of templates C and D compared to A is less clear without a formal statistical test.

### 3. Computational Cost in Sparse Logistic Regression

**Q:** What is the computational cost of gradient descent in sparse logistic regression?

**A:** The cost per iteration in sparse logistic regression is approximately `O(m * k)`, where `m` is the number of training examples and `k` is the average number of non-zero entries in each feature vector. This is significantly less than `O(m * n)` for dense vectors.

### 4. Text Classifier Training Data Generation

**Q:** Which approach is best for generating training data for a text classifier?

**A:** Approach 2, which involves getting 10k random labeled stories, is likely the most valuable for overall accuracy. It offers a balanced and representative sample of easy and hard examples. Approach 3 could be next, followed by Approach 1, though the ranking may vary based on the specific data.

### 5. Estimating Probability in Coin Toss

**Q:** What are the MLE, Bayesian, and MAP estimates for the probability `p` in a coin toss?

**A:** 
- **MLE:** The estimate is `k/n`, the proportion of heads observed.
- **Bayesian Estimate:** With a uniform prior, the estimate is `(k+1)/(n+2)`.
- **MAP Estimate:** The estimate is `k/(n+2)` for `k > 0` and `k < n`.

These estimates vary due to different assumptions in each method.
